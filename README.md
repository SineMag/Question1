# My history
At first, I discovered about data science in the year 2018 and did some research on it since it included knowledge of mathematics and usage of numeracy. One thing about me (out of many, of course), is that I loved mathematics and have always planned on becoming a doctor, until I met my high school maths teacher. 
The type of dedication, passion and knowledge of anything related to mathematics was inspiring. 
I then decided, even if I don't become a doctor for people, I am sure becoming great at maths.
For some time, I struggled to get into the programs that offered data science due to my back then inability to be far from home while not receiving enough to support my dependents.
Finally, on September 2020, I gathered the courage to move and look for jobs and luckily, I started on the 15th of October of the same year at my first professional job. 
I've worked as an admin assistant till this day. 
Also, I am forever grateful for the training, skills and development I've received with my current employer, and for allowing me, who had no admin skills, to join the team!
A little secrete about me is that I come from a rural area, but only after I tell you, you believe that, otherwise, I am defying a million odds. I am smart, generous and I pour my heart out when cooking!
